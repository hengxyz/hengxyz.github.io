I’m Zuheng Ming, an Enseignant-Cheurcheur Contactuel in the Computer Science department with [L3i](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/) at [La Rochelle University](https://www.univ-larochelle.fr/en/), France. Before that, I was a postdoc researcher and teaching assistant (vacataire) in the [L3i](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/) Lab of La Rochelle University supervised by [Pr. Jean-Christophe Burie](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/Burie-Jean-Christophe-MCF-HDR) and [Pr. Muriel Visani](https://pageperso.univ-lr.fr/mvisani/). I spent also one year and a half as a postdoc in the [LaBRI](https://www.labri.fr/) of the [University of Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.com/) supervised by [Pr. Aurélie Bugeau](https://www.labri.fr/perso/bugeau/index.php). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [Gipsa-lab](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/index.php) of the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) supervised by [Pr. Gang Feng](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/page_pro.php?vid=3995) and [Dr. Denis Beautemps](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/page_pro.php?vid=132). Prior to coming to France, I obtained the MSc degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) and BSc degree from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm) in China.

## Research Interests:
My research interests span in computer vision, vision & language and deep learning as well as its applications.  
- Applications: Biometrics (face anti-spoofing, face recognition, face detection); document images classifications;
- Methods: Supervised/Self-supervised deep learning methods (Transformers, CNNs, ...); Multimodal learning (text/vision), Multi-task learning and Metric learning; 
- Data: Natural images, heterogeneous data (text, visiaul images, 3D depth images, caricatures)  

## *News*:
