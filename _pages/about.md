Hi! I’m Zuheng Ming, an Enseignant-Cheurcheur Contactuel with [L3i](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/) at [La Rochelle University](https://www.univ-larochelle.fr/en/), France. Before that, I was a Postdoc researcher in the [L3i](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/) Lab of La Rochelle University supervised by [Prof. Jean-Christophe Burie](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/Burie-Jean-Christophe-MCF-HDR). I spent one year and half in the [LaBRI](https://www.labri.fr/) of the [University of Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.com/) supervised by [Prof. Aurélie Bugeau](https://www.labri.fr/perso/bugeau/index.php). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [Gipsa-lab](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/index.php) of the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) supervised by Prof. Gang Feng and [Dr. Denis Beautemps](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/page_pro.php?vid=132), the MSc degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) and BSc degree from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm) in China.

## My work and research
I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically investigate socio-technical systems of technology and knowledge production. I have a particular focus on decentralized communities and institutions, such as open source software, scientific research, peer production platforms (like Wikipedia), and social media sites. Most of my previous work has focused on [Wikipedia](http://enwp.org/Wikipedia), where I've studied the people and algorithms that produce and maintain an open encyclopedia. I’ve also studied scientific research networks and projects, including the [Long-Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/), the [Open Science Grid](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/), and the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments](http://msdse.org/). I study topics including newcomer socialization, cooperation and conflict, community governance, specialization and professionalization, information verification and quality control, hackathons and community workshops, the roles of support staff and technicians, bias and discrimination, and diversity and inclusion. I also often focus on how these issues all intersect with and are embedded in the design of software and automated systems.

## My background and history
I received my Ph.D from the [UC-Berkeley School of Information](http://ischool.berkeley.edu), my M.A. from the [Communication, Culture, and Technology program](http://cct.georgetown.edu) at Georgetown University, and my B.A. in [the Humanities program](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/humanities/) at the University of Texas at Austin. For just under five years after receiving my Ph.D, I was at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu) as a staff ethnographer. At BIDS, I was first a postdoctoral scholar, then became a principal investigator and led several research and education efforts, including the institute’s Data Science Studies efforts and the [Best Practices in Data Science](https://osf.io/ctfqn/) series.

## My intellectual communities
I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
