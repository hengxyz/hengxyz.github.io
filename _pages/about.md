I’m Zuheng Ming, an Enseignant-Cheurcheur Contactuel with [L3i](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/) at [La Rochelle University](https://www.univ-larochelle.fr/en/), France. Before that, I was a postdoc researcher in the [L3i](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/) Lab of La Rochelle University supervised by [Prof. Jean-Christophe Burie](https://l3i.univ-larochelle.fr/Burie-Jean-Christophe-MCF-HDR) and [Prof. Muriel Visani](https://pageperso.univ-lr.fr/mvisani/). I spent also one year and a half as a postdoc in the [LaBRI](https://www.labri.fr/) of the [University of Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.com/) supervised by [Prof. Aurélie Bugeau](https://www.labri.fr/perso/bugeau/index.php). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [Gipsa-lab](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/index.php) of the [University of Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) supervised by [Prof. Gang Feng](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/page_pro.php?vid=3995) and [Dr. Denis Beautemps](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/page_pro.php?vid=132). Prior to coming to France, I obtained the MSc degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) and BSc degree from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm) in China.

## Research Interests:
My research interests span in computer vision, vision & language and machine learning. More specifically, my primary researches are about structured visual understanding at different levels and how to further leverage them for intelligent interactions with human through language and environment through embodiment. I believe, by integrating fine-grained structured information, we can achieve better yet interpretable, grounded and robust multi-modality intelligent agent.
